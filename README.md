# NOTE

Even tho these are my powershells, for privacy reasons, ill obfuscate them (poorly) to avoid people just putting their names on it...

Still, they will be poorly obfuscated, if you have any security concerns, you can go and see it's code, it's just a little "iq test"

## replaceparser.exe

what is it?
its a simple journal parser and replace analyzer made in c#.
why dont upload it in a separate repo as any other project?
the main journal parse is basically stolen from [Journaltrace](https://github.com/ponei/JournalTrace) and the main replace part is the worst code i've ever seen in my life, but it works!!

still, its not obfuscated, if u wanna see its code, use dnspy, it's not ratted..
